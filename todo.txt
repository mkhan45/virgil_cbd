# "Static"

def I32_EQZ() {
	var x = pop_i32();
	if (x == 0) {
	    push_i32(1);
	} else {
	    push_i32(0);
	}
}

def BR_IF() {
	var depth = readImmULEB32();
	var label #sidetable = f_getLabel(depth);
	var cond = pop_i32();
	if (cond != 0) doBranch(label);
	else doFallThru();
	return void;
}

At first, it looks like both conditionals are not known statically.
However, in the validator the type of x in eqz is a TypeVar, and
TypeVar.I32.eqz is known statically. However, cond is a runtime i32,
so eqz is not static.

This reasoning is kind of goofy, but I think it makes sense
