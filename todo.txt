# "Static"

def I32_EQZ() {
	var x = pop_i32();
	if (x == 0) {
	    push_i32(1);
	} else {
	    push_i32(0);
	}
}

def BR_IF() {
	var depth = readImmULEB32();
	var label #sidetable = f_getLabel(depth);
	var cond = pop_i32();
	if (cond != 0) doBranch(label);
	else doFallThru();
	return void;
}

At first, it looks like both conditionals are not known statically.
However, in the validator the type of x in eqz is a TypeVar, and
TypeVar.I32.eqz is known statically. However, cond is a runtime i32,
so eqz is not static.

This reasoning is kind of goofy, but I think it makes sense

it doesnt make sense

i think we should do an effects system. there should be a push
effect and a control xfer effect (or sidetable modification)

we can change fn types per cbd instantiation, including their effects

we can also kind of use this to typecheck the CBDs themselves, because
if there are an unequal amount of push effects in two branches it
can't be a valid WASM instruction
