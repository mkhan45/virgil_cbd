# Sea of Variables

The sea of variables is a graph-based IR used for analysis, optimization, and scheduling. It sits between the SSAD textual IR and the final generated code. Constructed from SSAD via `Seas.ofSSAD()`, it represents computations as an unordered dependency graph that is then scheduled back into a linear/structured form.

## Core Types

- **`Sea`** — The graph container holding `IRNode`s. Provides graph analysis (LCA), Mermaid visualization, and cloning (`Seas.clone()`, `Seas.cloneSubgraph()`).
- **`IRNode`** — Graph nodes with `value_deps` (data flow), `state_deps` (one slot per `StateComponent` variant, sized to `StateComponent.count` and indexed by `.tag`), and `children` (reverse edges). Each carries `VarData` (name, type, stage) and an `IROp`.
- **`IROp`** — Node operation enum: `Start`, `Finish`, `Intrinsic(defn)`, `Lit(tipe, rep)`, `Phi`, `StatePhi(statecomps)`, `Move(val)`.
- **`NodeSet` / `ImmNodeSet`** — Mutable and immutable node set types used throughout for graph analysis.

## Graph Rewrite Passes

Applied via `sea.apply()`:

- `id_propagate` — Eliminates identity intrinsics
- `removeViews` — Eliminates view intrinsics
- `overloadOps` — Resolves type-polymorphic operators to type-specific ones (e.g., `+` → `i32_+`)
- `addAbstractions` — Inserts `lift_*` operations for static-to-runtime transitions
- `unLEM` — Rewrites runtime conditionals for abstract interpretation (both-branches execution)
- `constUnLEM` — Constant-folds trivial unLEM rewrites
- `reifyConds` — Inserts `startIf`/`startElse`/`end` control flow markers
- `chooseMerge` — Simplifies merge nodes

## Inspecting Sea Graphs

Sea graphs are written to `docs/traces.js` by the scheduler test harness. To print the Mermaid form of the Sea IR for one opcode:

```bash
bash scripts/schedule_test.sh --trace SPLIT_BRANCHES
node scripts/schedule_info.js SPLIT_BRANCHES raw
node scripts/schedule_info.js SPLIT_BRANCHES unLEM
```

Use `--canonical` for real opcodes from `CanonicalDefs.v3`, for example `bash scripts/schedule_test.sh --canonical --trace IF IF`. The `raw` tag is the pre-schedule Sea IR; `unLEM` is the Sea IR after `SeaTransforms.unLEM`.

## Scheduling

`common/sea/Schedule.v3` converts the unordered sea graph back into structured code in two phases.

### Phase 1: Untangle

Resolves shared subgraphs between branches. Uses `branch_partition` (on `Sea`) to compute, for each phi node, a `BranchPartition` containing the left subgraph, right subgraph, and frontier (nodes reachable from both sides). `find_branch_lattices` groups phi nodes that share the same condition into `BranchLattice`s, merging their partitions. Lattices are topologically sorted so inner branches are processed first. For each lattice, the shared frontier nodes are cloned (`Seas.cloneSubgraph`) into each branch so no node belongs to both sides, then lattices are recomputed.

### Phase 2: Bottom-Up Schedule

Walks from `Finish` upward, placing each node into the lowest valid position in a `ScheduleNode` tree (composed of `ScheduleBlock`, `ScheduleBranch`, and `CFGPhi` nodes). `isReady` checks whether all of a node's live children have been scheduled (tracked via `DomGraph`). Phi nodes use grouped readiness: all children across the `BranchLattice` must be scheduled before any phi in the group is enqueued. When a phi becomes ready, `prependScheduleBranch` inserts a new `ScheduleBranch`/`CFGPhi` pair into the schedule tree.

### Move Nodes

`IROp.Move(val)` nodes are inserted by the `addMoves` transform before scheduling. Each phi's condition node gets `move_true`/`move_false` children via `init_move`, which act as branch-side markers. The scheduler skips Move nodes during placement (they are not live) but uses them to associate values with their correct branch side. `CFGPhi.toSSAD` unwraps Move nodes when emitting phi assignments.

## ScheduleChecker

`common/sea/CheckSchedule.v3` verifies scheduler output by checking four properties:

1. **Dependency ordering** (`check_top_down`) — Walks the scheduled CFG top-down maintaining a scope of already-scheduled nodes. For each node, verifies all its dependencies are in scope before it executes.

2. **Graph equivalence** — Compares the scheduled graph against the original via `graph_eq` to ensure the dependency structure is preserved.

3. **Path effects** (`check_path_effects`) — Enumerates all possible branch paths (2^n combinations for n conditions, up to n=20) and verifies that each path executes the same set of effectful nodes in both the graph and the CFG.
   - `collect_graph_effs`: Walks the sea graph backward from `Finish`, following all `value_deps` and `state_deps`. At Phi/StatePhi nodes, follows only the branch matching the current assignment. Collects all `Intrinsic` nodes with non-empty `writes`.
   - `collect_cfg_effs`: Walks the scheduled CFG forward. At `ScheduleBranch`, follows only the active branch per assignment. Collects effectful nodes from `ScheduleBlock.prims`.

4. **Effect count conservation** — For each path, compares the number of effectful nodes between the original sea (`orig_sea`) and the scheduled sea (`new_sea`). Detects over-cloning by untangle (new > orig) or lost effects (new < orig). Conditions are mapped from `new_sea` to `orig_sea` by node ID (preserved by `Seas.clone`), bypassing the `orig_to_new` mapping which can be corrupted by untangle's clone remapping.

### ScheduleError Variants

- `UnsatNeed(user, needed)` — A node was scheduled before one of its dependencies
- `BadOrdering(fst, snd)` — Two nodes appear in the wrong order
- `GraphDiff(diff)` — The scheduled graph structure differs from the original
- `PathEffectMismatch(path, graph_only, cfg_only)` — On a given branch path, effects differ between graph and CFG
- `EffectCountMismatch(path, orig_effs, new_effs)` — On a given branch path, the number of effectful nodes differs from the original (indicates over-cloning or lost effects)

## DomGraph

`common/sea/DomGraph.v3` — Hierarchical dominance tracking with public/private node sets and parent chains. Used by the bottom-up scheduler to track which `IRNode`s have been scheduled before a given point, enabling readiness checks. The public/private distinction allows branch-specific nodes (like `Move` nodes) to be visible only within their branch.
